- Why does there seem to be this gap in the 1950s-1970s of any significant African-American [[data]] being visualized in creative ways? It's all utilitarian in the Crisis, with graphs and charts displaying statistics information, but nothing as vibrant or artistic as the visualizations of the early 20th century. What happened?
- Lack of global Black DH "wikis" or a historical article about the chronology, because everyone is siloed by detail
	- Perhaps this is exactly the point of [The Garden and the Stream- A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) That we lack open educational resources on a higher-level, since we're so busy poking in the weeds.
